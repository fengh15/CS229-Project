To play against the trained agent, run the file TDNSC.py and follow the prompts, entering in 'h' for a human player when the prompt appears.
To enter a move, type the lowest card of the move and the pattern that follows
For example, to play JJQQ, you would type 'J 2,2'; to play a 3, you would type '3 1'; to play 7788899, you would type '7 2,3,2'



The pickle files contain the TD agents that performed the best after several rounds of TDNS. TDsNew.pickle contains the algorithms trained
  with more complex features. These are used by the TDNSC.py, and can be loaded if by typing in the name at the first prompt.
  
TD.py contains the code for the TD algorithm, all the agents, and the game class. TD2, TD3, and TD4 were different attempts to add features
  to TD. None of these made any improvements.
TDUtil contains some helper functions that TD.py and its successors use.
